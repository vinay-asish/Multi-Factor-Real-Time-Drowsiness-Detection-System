# ðŸ’¤ Multi-Factor Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System

This repository contains a real-time drowsiness detection system that leverages multiple physiological and behavioral indicators such as eye closure, yawn frequency, and head pose. The system uses computer vision techniques built on top of **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to ensure robust, real-time monitoring.

## ðŸ§  Project Motivation

Drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents, especially for long-distance drivers. Relying on a single metric like eye blink can be unreliable in varied conditions. This project implements a **multi-factor detection system** to improve reliability and robustness by combining several visual cues.
